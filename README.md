# AI Email Summarization – North Star Metrics

## Product Goal
Accelerate professional decision-making by delivering concise, contextually accurate email summaries through an AI-powered pipeline, reducing cognitive load and time spent processing high-volume inboxes.

## North Star Metric (NSM)
**Weekly Active Summarized Emails (WASE)**  
- Definition: Number of emails successfully summarized and actively consumed by users per week.  
- Rationale: Captures the ultimate value delivered — measurable reduction in user effort and increased engagement with summarized content. Serves as the primary leading indicator for retention, adoption, and productivity gains.

## Input / Leading Metrics
These drive the NSM and provide actionable levers:  
1. **Active Users Performing Summarization (AUPS):** Tracks adoption and recurring engagement.  
2. **Average Summaries per User per Week (ASPW):** Quantifies intensity of usage; correlates with NSM growth.  
3. **Summary Accuracy Score (SAS):** Combines AI confidence and user validation to ensure output fidelity.  
4. **Time Saved per User (TSPU):** Estimated minutes saved; directly reflects user value creation.

## Guardrail / Safety Metrics
Ensure NSM optimization does not degrade quality or user experience:  
- **AI Hallucination Rate (AHR):** % of summaries with factually inaccurate or misleading content.  
- **Error Rate per Email (ERE):** Monitors pipeline reliability and system robustness.  
- **Churn Rate (CR):** Tracks retention impact; prevents short-term NSM gains from harming long-term growth.  
- **User Feedback Score (UFS):** Average post-summary rating; ensures qualitative UX signals are monitored.

## Why Not Vanity Metrics
Metrics like total downloads, total AI calls, or raw usage counts inflate activity signals without correlating to **actual user value**.  
> For example, high AI call volume does not guarantee accurate summaries or meaningful productivity gains. Focusing on WASE, input metrics, and guardrails ensures we optimize **outcomes over outputs**.

## Optional Extensions
